# OMDB Titles Browser
A simple web app to browse information about Movies, TV Series, and more in the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/ "OMDB API's Website")'s Dataset.

### Notes:
* For demo purposes. The [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/ "OMDB API's Website")
 key for this project is exposed. Please do not use the API key for any purposes other than running this web app.
* Due to the limitations of the OMDB API, I will replace it with [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started "TMDB API Section") and secure the new API key in future versions of this app.
