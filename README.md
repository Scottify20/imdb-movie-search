# OMDB Titles Browser (In development)
A simple web app to browse information about Movies, TV Series, and more in the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/ "OMDB API's Website")'s Dataset.

### Notes:
* For demo purposes. The [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/ "OMDB API's Website")
 key for this project is exposed. Please do not use the API key for any purposes other than running this web app.
* Due to the limitations of the OMDB API, I will be replacing it with [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started "TMDB API Section") and secure the new API key in future versions of this app.

## Screenshots
* This is just a preview since the app is still in development. I will also add screenshots for other device form factors later
