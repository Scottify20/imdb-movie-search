# IMDB Titles Search
A web app to browse information about titles included in the IMDB dataset. Titles include Movies, TV Series, and more.

### Notes:
* For demo purposes. The OMDB API key for this project is exposed. Please do not use the API key for any purposes other than running this web app.
* Due to the limitations of the OMDB API, I will replace it with TMDB API and secure the new API key in future versions of this app.
