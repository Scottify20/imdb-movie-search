# OMDB Titles Browser (In development)

A simple web app to browse information about Movies, TV Series, and more in the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/ "OMDB API's Website")'s Dataset.

### Notes:
- Due to the limitations of the OMDB API, I will be gradually replacing it with [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started 'TMDB API Section').
